<b>Animation</b> is a filmmaking technique whereby still images are manipulated to create moving images. In traditional animation, images are drawn or painted by hand on <em>transparent celluloid sheets</em> to be photographed and exhibited on film. <strong>Animation</strong> has been recognized as an artistic medium, specifically within the entertainment industry. Many animations are either traditional animations or computer animations made with computer-generated imagery (CGI). Stop motion animation, in particular claymation, has continued to exist alongside these other forms.</p>
